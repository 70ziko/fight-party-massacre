# STICK PARTY MASSACRE

A dynamic mobile fighting party game with a twist!

## Gameplay

The game has 3 dynamic turns each lasting a specified amount of time, in these stages the players:

1. Choose the item they will want to spawn, place or equip - 7-10s
2. Place the item on the map - 5s
3. Use the environment and attacks to overpower the challenger

This takes turns in a loop until one of the players loses all HP.

### Physics

The whole game is supposed to be physics-based, meaning:

- coded animations (maybe with forces, but let's not get too complicated)
- physics based damage:
  - maiming limbs and body is the way to win

## UI

### stats

HP and others will be visible on the stickmans themselves either as a vertical color filling, kind of blood escaping (no bleeding mechanism tho) or just the state of the body hah

### Controls

A joystick on the left for movement and two buttons:

- attack
- dash (in any way, so also works as a jump)
